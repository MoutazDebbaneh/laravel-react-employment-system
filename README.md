# laravel-react-employment-system

This graduation project aims to create a Single Page Application for job seekers looking for jobs, and employers looking for employees.
The backend is implemented using Laravel, and the frontend is implemented using React. Also, connecting the two ends is made via Inertia.js.
Also, the system is configured to extract vacancies available on real local websites, namely Forsa.sy and
Career.sy, through API calls and Web Scraping to gather as many opportunities as possible in a single
place.
